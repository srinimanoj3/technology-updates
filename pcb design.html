<h4>Whatis PCB?</h4>
<p>Printed circuit board (PCB) design brings your electronic circuits to life in the physical form. Using layout software, the PCB design process combines component placement and routing to define electrical connectivity on a manufactured circuit board.</p>
<h4>What is difference between PCB and PCBA?</h4>
<p>PCB refers to the circuit board, while PCBA refers to the circuit board plug-in assembly, SMT process. One is a finished board and the other is a bare board.PCB(Printed Circuit Board)，Made of epoxy glass resin material, it is divided into 4, 6 and 8 layers according to the number of signal layers.</p>
<h4>Which is the best PCB design software?</h4>
<p>Most useful and common CAD software for PCB designing is EAGLE. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor.Here i give some of pcb design softwares as overview.</p>
