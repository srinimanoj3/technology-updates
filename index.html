<h1 class="heading">Siemens tries to close the circle</h1>
<marquee direction="up" height="60%">
<p class="para">At first sight the recent purchases by Siemens’ industrial software operations do not seem to connect but the group thinks it can already show how to build a coherent whole out of the jigsaw pieces.Having embarked on a buying spree that has over the past few years brought together companies such as electronics design specialist Mentor Graphics and Mendix, a Boston-based developer of tools for speeding up the creation of mobile and web apps, Siemens PLM Software last week said it was time to change its name to reflect its wider scope.The group, now known as Siemens Digital Industries Software (DIS), used a conference in New York organised for analysts to make a case as to why all the pieces fit together.The main components are the product-lifecycle management software TeamCenter that gave the group its former name; a collection of simulation and computer-aided design (CAD) tools that now encompass mechanical, electrical and electronic work; and the MindSphere cloud-based environment for co-ordinating IoT systems. Rather than build them into some kind of super-package, Siemens is unbundling some of the components, offering them as rented ‘microservices’ running on cloud servers. Instead, Hemmelgarn and his lieutenants expect Mendix to act as the glue, with customers deciding how they can best use the tools. Because Mendix is presented as numerous pre-cooked components that users wire together to build workflows and user interfaces, Siemens reckons more customers will seize upon a greater ability to customise.“I call it the CIO pressure-relief valve,” Tony Hemmelgarn, Siemens DIS president and CEO said in his keynote, because they will not have to budget for additional IT staff. Instead, engineers and other domain experts at customers will build their own apps: “They can say: ‘I don’t like this app; I want to change it’.”Many have already been doing it in an ad hoc manner by building spreadsheets and scripts that cull information pulled out of software like TeamCenter, such as bills of material. “They can do it without creating shadow databases,” Hemmelgarn said. “The IT guys know they’ve got guys developing shadow databases. This way, customers preserve revision and access control but they can put development in the hands of the users.”How does that work in practice? Hemmelgarn claims it gives IoT deployments much greater power than many existing applications suggest. Siemens promotes the idea of a maturity model, similar to those used for software development, that users can follow. Simple monitoring of devices is right at the bottom of that maturity model.“Everyone starts with preventive maintenance,” Hemmelgarn argues. “When we show customers the ability to make a round trip so they can fix problems [in the design] that makes a big difference.”How does this work in practice? Siemens has some examples. Local Motors, which is developing the Olli autonomous people-mover, has an application built using the Mendix tools that does not just track the real-time behaviour of its systems but which supports changes to the design.According to Ralf-Michael Wagner, chief operating officer of Siemens’ MindSphere group, the vehicle maker uses a variety of Siemens design products such as MindSphere, NX for CAD, simulation tools and the TeamCenter PLM package. Now they are wiring these tools together using the Mendix app builder. In his presentation of how Olli design engineers use the software, Wagner showed a situation where sensors indicated a brake rotor running hot. The app pulls data from the PLM and CAD tools to show where the problem is appearing. In addition, it shows the results of simulations of the design before the vehicle was made. “The engineer can check: does the simulation behave the same way?” Wagner said. If the simulation has not captured the problem, it almost needs certainly updating. If on the other hand it is a likely condition but not one that the product-engineering team originally expected to be met, they can opt to make a change to the vehicle design itself – either to the next generation or possibly when this machine comes in for a service. “At that point, you have identified, in simulation, a new material for the brake rotor,” Wagner said, adding: “It was all done in Mendix in a few weeks.”Shipyard crane builder Konecranes was a customer that set out to use IoT sensors to do standard maintenance prediction around three years ago. Andreas Geiss, CTO for cloud app solutions at Siemens, said: “Over time Konecranes has developed. They said it’s great feedback we are getting [from the machines] but how can we feed the data back into crane designs?” Similar to Olli, Konecranes is now pulling data out of Mindsphere and combining it with functions in TeamCenter and SimCenter to try to streamline the way it creates new designs and potentially even change the way it sells the machinery. “Typically, in the past, when Konecranes got a request for a new crane setup they took customer requests and went back to cranes they had built already. Mechanical engineers don’t like to reinvent: you take what you have done already and optimise from that. However, this means you tend to over-engineer everything. You deliver cranes that are way more complex and may be delivered for different capacity than what is actually needed,” Geiss explained. Using the operational data from existing cranes, Konecranes was able to build better simulations that the company used to drive the new-product design process, with greater ability to fine-tune the characteristics of each order.  The next step is to offer customers the ability to rent lifting capacity rather than selling cranes to harbour logistics providers, who, according to Geiss want better uptime and lower capex. In principle, because the cranes can be more closely matched to the need and maintained that way through real-time data from the cranes themselves, the overall system will be more efficient. Referring to Siemens’ three-level concept of digital maturity, Geiss said: “Konecranes started at connect and monitor. They moved over to analyse and predict and now its digitalise and transform. But without the first step I don’t think they could have come up with this approach.”</p>

<h1 class="heading">NASA helping ISRO establish communication with Vikram lander</h1>
<marquee direction="up" height="50%">
<p class="para">Chennai: The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is continuing its attempt to reach out to India’s moon lander sending communication signals with its Deep Space Network (DSN), said officials.It is also reported the American space agency National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is sending radio signals to Vikram.“Attempts are being made to reestablish communication links with the moon lander Vikram. The attempts will be made till September 20-21 when the sunlight will be there in the area where the Vikram has landed,” an ISRO official preferring anonymity told IANS.The ISRO is trying to establish link with Vikram with its Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu near Bengaluru.Scott Tilley, an amateur astronomer who found American weather satellite IMAGE in 2018 that was considered to be lost, on September 10, tweeted: “#DSN 24 beams 12KW of RF at the #Moon in hopes of stimulating #Chandrayaan2’s lander #VikramLander into communicating with home.“Here’s a eerie recording of the searcher’s signal reflected off the Moon and back to Earth via EME (Earth Moon Earth) on 2103.7MHz.”“Meanwhile the DSN24 continues emitting its beacon in hopes #VikramLander will respond…A Good Night all!” he said in a recent tweet.The IMAGE satellite was launched by NASA in 2000 and lost contact after five years.</p>

<marquee direction="up" height="60%">
<p class="para">Inching towards the edge of discovery</br>Are you ready for the unknown?</br>Chandrayaan 2 is an Indian lunar mission that will boldly go where no country has ever gone before — the Moon’s south polar region. Through this effort, the aim is to improve our understanding of the Moon — discoveries that will benefit India and humanity as a whole. These insights and experiences aim at a paradigm shift in how lunar expeditions are approached for years to come — propelling further voyages into the farthest frontiers.</br>Why are we going to the Moon?</br>The Moon is the closest cosmic body at which space discovery can be attempted and documented. It is also a promising test bed to demonstrate technologies required for deep-space missions. Chandrayaan 2 attempts to foster a new age of discovery, increase our understanding of space, stimulate the advancement of technology, promote global alliances, and inspire a future generation of explorers and scientists.</br>What are the scientific objectives of Chandrayaan 2? Why explore the Lunar South Pole?</br>Moon provides the best linkage to Earth’s early history. It offers an undisturbed historical record of the inner Solar system environment. Though there are a few mature models, the origin of Moon still needs further explanations. Extensive mapping of lunar surface to study variations in lunar surface composition is essential to trace back the origin and evolution of the Moon. Evidence for water molecules discovered by Chandrayaan-1, requires further studies on the extent of water molecule distribution on the surface, below the surface and in the tenuous lunar exosphere to address the origin of water on Moon.</br>The lunar South Pole is especially interesting because of the lunar surface area here that remains in shadow is much larger than that at the North Pole. There is a possibility of the presence of water in permanently shadowed areas around it. In addition, South Pole region has craters that are cold traps and contain a fossil record of the early Solar System.</br>Chandrayaan-2 will attempt to soft land the lander -Vikram and rover- Pragyan in a high plain between two craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N, at a latitude of about 70° south.</br>What makes Chandrayaan 2 special?</br>1st space mission to conduct a soft landing on the Moon’s south polar region</br>1st Indian expedition to attempt a soft landing on the lunar surface with home-grown technology</br>1st Indian mission to explore the lunar terrain with home-grown technology</br>4th country ever to soft land on the lunar surface</br>Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark-III (GSLV Mk-III)</br>The GSLV Mk-III will carry Chandrayaan 2 to its designated orbit. This three-stage vehicle is India’s most powerful launcher to date, and is capable of launching 4-ton class of satellites to the Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).At the time of launch, the Chandrayaan 2 Orbiter will be capable of communicating with Indian Deep Space Network (IDSN) at Byalalu as well as the Vikram Lander. The mission life of the Orbiter is one year and it will be placed in a 100X100 km lunar polar orbit.</br>Lander — Vikram</br>Weight</br>1,471 kg</br>Electric Power Generation Capability</br>650 W</br>The Lander of Chandrayaan 2 is named Vikram after Dr Vikram A Sarabhai, the Father of the Indian Space Programme. It is designed to function for one lunar day, which is equivalent to about 14 Earth days. Vikram has the capability to communicate with IDSN at Byalalu near Bangalore, as well as with the Orbiter and Rover. The Lander is designed to execute a soft landing on the lunar surface.</br>Rover — Pragyan</br>Weight</br>27 kg</br>Electric Power Generation Capability</br>50 W</br>Chandrayaan 2’s Rover is a 6-wheeled robotic vehicle named Pragyan, which translates to ‘wisdom’ in Sanskrit. It can travel up to 500 m (½-a-km) and leverages solar energy for its functioning. It can only communicate with the Lander.</br>Timeline of the mission</br>18th September, 2008</br>Prime Minister Manmohan Singh approves the Chandrayaan2 lunar mission</br>Mission Planning</br>Launch Date</br>July 22, 2019</br>Landing on Moon</br>Sep 7, 2019</br>Scientific Experiment on Moon</br>1 Lunar day (14 earth days)</br>Orbital Experiment</br>Will be operational for 1 year</p>

<h1>Apple buys Intel’s smartphone modem unit for $1 billion</h1>
<marquee direction="up" height="70%">
<p>Apple Inc took a major step toward supplying its own smartphone chips by purchasing the majority of Intel Corp’s modem business in a deal valued at $1 billion, the companies said on Thursday.Under the deal, about 2,200 Intel employees will join Apple, along with intellectual property, equipment and leases. Combined with its existing portfolio, Apple will have 17,000 wireless technology patents, ranging from cellular communication standards to modems, making it a more powerful player in global licensing talks that will likely take place between major 5G patent holders such as Huawei Technologies Co Ltd.Intel shares rose 5.7% to $55.05 after the news and the company’s report that its earnings beat analysts’ expectations. Apple shares edged up 0.1% to $207.29.After the deal, Intel will retain the right to develop modems for non-smartphone applications, such as PCs, industrial equipment and self-driving cars.Modem chips connect devices like the iPhone to wireless data networks, but Apple has always relied on outside suppliers for the part. Intel positioned itself as the sole source of iPhone modem chips over the past year after Apple got into a prolonged legal fight with previous supplier Qualcomm Inc over Qualcomm patent licensing practices.Cupertino, California-based Apple reached a surprise settlement in April that called for the iPhone to once again use Qualcomm modem chips. Within hours, Intel said it would quit the smartphone modem business.Apple’s acquisitions have mostly been much smaller companies, making the Intel deal its second-largest ever after its $3.2 billion purchase of Beats Electronics in 2014.The deal with Intel will bolster Apple’s goal to make its own modem chip. Two of Apple’s biggest global rivals – Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei – already have the ability to self-supply modem chips.Technology news publication The Information last year reported Apple’s efforts to develop its own modem, but the iPhone maker has never formally acknowledged it. In February, Reuters reported that Apple moved its modem engineering efforts into the same chip design unit that makes the custom processors for its devices, signaling a doubling down on the pursuit of self-designed modem chip.Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has also long said the company wants to control its own technological fate, what analysts have called the “Cook Doctrine.”“We believe that we need to own and control the primary technologies behind the products that we make,” Tim Cook told investors back in 2009.Speeding up developmentThe purchase of Intel’s assets could help Apple meet its aggressive timeline for producing a modem.A person familiar with the matter said Apple plans to use Qualcomm’s modem technology for a 5G iPhone in 2020 but wants to have an internally developed 5G modem technology ready for use in some of its products by 2021. Intel previously disclosed plans to have a 5G modem ready by 2020, so tapping the Intel assets could help Apple hit its target.But any replacement of Qualcomm is likely to happen in phases, this person said, as Apple builds up its ability to ensure that its modems work on all the networks and countries where Apple sells phones. Ensuring worldwide compatibility is Qualcomm’s historical strength, and Apple might still have to rely on Qualcomm for some modems during a transition period to its own devices.“There’s a fierce desire (at Apple) to have Independence, but they also realize it has to be done responsibly,” this person said.Apple’s license deal with Qualcomm lasts six years and its accompanying chip supply agreement could also last that long, said one chip industry veteran who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Apple is likely to continue to use the San Diego firm’s chips in its flagship models even if it phases in its own silicon for lower-end and older models, this person said.Apple has engaged with Taiwan’s Global Unichip Corp, a chip design house in which Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co is an investor, to explore a modem design, but the work is in early stages.“Clearly Apple saw the handwriting on the wall, because they came around and did a deal with Qualcomm,” this person said.Apple declined to comment on its plans, and Qualcomm and Global Unichip did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Patents as leverageThe most valuable aspect of the Intel deal for Apple could turn out to be patents. To sell a 5G iPhone, Apple will need to strike deals with the major holders of 5G patents, including Nokia, Ericsson, Huawei and Qualcomm. Apple executed a licensing deal with Qualcomm, but it has not disclosed whether it has deals in place with the others.Erick Robinson, a patent attorney who had worked in Qualcomm’s licensing division in Asia, said the patents could give Apple better leverage in licensing talks.“I don’t think Intel has quite the portfolio that Qualcomm has, but they certainly have a large enough one to impact the valuations when it comes to a cross-licensing deal,” he said. “It’ll save (Apple) a huge chunk of change in cross-license deals.”</p>
