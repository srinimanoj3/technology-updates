<p>BAnother buzzword that no longer remains a buzzword but has become a full-fledged technology ecosystem in itself.<br>
IoT essentially is connecting many devices and creating a virtual network where everything works seamlessly via a single monitoring center of sorts.<br>
IoT is a giant network of connected devices – all of which gather and share data about how they are used and the environments in which they are operated.</p>
<p>This includes everything from your:<br>
mobile phones,<br>
refrigerator,<br>
washing machines to almost everything that you can think of.</p>
<p>With IoT, we can have smart cities with optimized:<br>
traffic system,<br>
efficient waste management and<br>
energy use</p>
